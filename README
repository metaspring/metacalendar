MetaCalendar
============

Provides a calendar method which takes a date and displays a calendar for the date's month. If no date is provided, the url parameters are checked for :year and :month and parsed to show the calendar for that month. 

Each calendar day's date can also be used within a block to display custom content for that day.

Example
=======

<% calendar do |date| %>
  <% events = @events.select { |event| event.day == date } %>

	<% events.each do |event| %>
		<p><%= event.title %></p>
	<% end %>
<% end %>

The calendar method can also take a date:

	<% calendar(:date => (Date.today << 1)) %>

By default, the next and previous month links are generated assuming a calendar controller is being used but a different url hash can also be passed:

	<% calendar(:url => { :controller => :events }) do |date| %>
	<% end %>
