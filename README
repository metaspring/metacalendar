MetaCalendar
============

Provides a calendar method which takes a date and displays a calendar for the date's month. If no date is provided, the url parameters are checked for :year and :month and parsed to show the calendar for that month. 

Each calendar day's date can also be used within a block to display custom content for that day.

Example
=======

<% calendar do |date| %>
  <% events = @events.select { |event| event.day == date } %>

	<% events.each do |event| %>
		<p><%= event.title %></p>
	<% end %>
<% end %>

The calendar method can also take a date:

<% calendar(Date.today << 1) %>
